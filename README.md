## Exercise

#### Requirements

**You can work in pairs on this lab.**

Let's listen to some music with our very own Hotify app! You will create a streaming music player using services.

* Whether you stream the song or save it in your project, Hotify should be able to play one song using services
* Hotify has one screen - make this screen have three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop
  * Each button will control the playback of the song

**Bonus:**

* Make Hotify able to play more than one song
* Show a notification when the song service is started
* Be able to control the song playback through the notification

#### Deliverable

An Android Studio project, with no particular format. It just has to meet the requirements above.
